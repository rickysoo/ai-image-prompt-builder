# Build Your Image Prompt

Welcome to the ultimate AI image prompting tool! This interactive app helps you create amazing prompts for AI art generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Local Development
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

Your API key from `.env.local` will be automatically loaded and the app will work with full AI prompt enhancement!

### Direct Browser Opening (Alternative)
If you prefer to open `index.html` directly:
- The app will use fallback prompt generation (no AI enhancement)
- For AI features, use the development server above

## 🔧 Configuration

The app automatically reads your OpenAI API key from `.env.local` when using the development server. This keeps your API key secure and out of version control.

## 📦 Deployment

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed deployment instructions for Vercel and other platforms.
